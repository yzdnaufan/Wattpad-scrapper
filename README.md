# Wattpad-srapper

# How to use

- clone this repo
- make sure your ChromeDriver is version 103.0.5060.134
- run the notebook files

### Note : Please don't close opened browser when running the program. It is for fetching HTML files. If still not sure how it does, check the selenium_get_web.py for more information
### Weakness : Biggest flaw is the javascrip scroll implemented in wattpad pages, BS4 could not fetch more than 20 titles, so Selenium is used as for the current solution
